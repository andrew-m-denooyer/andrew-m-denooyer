## Hi there 👋

I'm Andrew, a .NET developer focused on building thoughtfully architected data pipelines and backend infrastructure.

## 🏗️ What I Build

My core work centers around **C# and .NET** (both the legacy .NET Framework and modern .NET), building:

- **Data ingestion pipelines** that reliably move and transform data at scale
- **Background task libraries** for ASP.NET Core applications
- **Well-architected systems** designed for maintainability and performance
- SQL Server integrations that actually work the way they should

I care about clean architecture, thoughtful design patterns, and code that the next person (or future me) won't curse at.

## 🔧 Clearing Roadblocks

When something gets in the way of real work, I'll spin up a quick utility to eliminate the annoyance:

- **[soft-mon](https://github.com/andrew-m-denooyer/soft-mon)** *(coming soon)*: Got tired of enterprise security scans flagging dev machines for CVEs, so I wrote this to automate software updates from our Nexus server. Problem eliminated, back to building.

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Primary:** C# • .NET Framework • .NET (modern) • ASP.NET Core • SQL Server
